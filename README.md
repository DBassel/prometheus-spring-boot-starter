# A Spring Boot Starter for Prometheus

This is Spring Boot Starter module for activating a Prometheus endpoint in Spring Boot applications.

There are one or a few others but as far as I know they don't:
- Activate the Prometheus endpoint as a real Spring Boot Actuator endpoint
- Exist in the official Maven repository
